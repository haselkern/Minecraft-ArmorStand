# Minecraft Armor Stand

This project is currently being rewritten. This document should be changed to include help for users and then help for contributors, especially translators.

## TODO
The following things still have to be done. Possibly in this order.
- [ ] Equipment
- [ ] Equipment locking
  - [ ] Can we scrape the MC wiki for a searchable dropdown list? https://minecraft.fandom.com/api.php ?
  - [ ] Colors for leather pieces
  - [ ] Helmet: player name
  - [ ] Helmet: Image URL
  - [ ] Helmet: https://minecraft-heads.com -> but use Minecraft-URL or Player name and skip the give code thing, that was confusing anyways. Have a help popup that explains this functionality with a few screenshots.
- [ ] Custom name with styling options
- [ ] Code generation
- [ ] **Proper rotation conversion between Minecraft and ThreeJS**
  - [ ] /summon or /give
- [ ] Hint for command block
- [ ] Design
- [ ] Save and load
- [ ] Tips and tricks section?
  - Double click a slider to reset
  - You can save and load
  - How to remove an invulnerable armor stand
- [ ] Ask before exit
- [ ] vue i18n
- [ ] vue element transitions
