Minecraft Armor Stand
=================

### [Try it out](http://haselkern.github.io/Minecraft-ArmorStand)

In Minecraft 1.8 Armor stands were introduced. Unfortunately, the syntax to summon one is quite confusing and not very intuitive, especially when you're trying to create an awesome pose. This tool provides a graphical interface so that you can focus on the looks and not worry about the code.

If you would like to see a feature implemented, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
